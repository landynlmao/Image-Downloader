# Image-Downloader
Internet image downloader in full quality
Code is intended to be customizable to your computer. Code will not work unless you add your specified download directory to the code because I was too lazy to add inputs.
Open ImageDL.py and then remove C:/Users/LJ_44/Desktop/ and replace it with where you want your images to be saved.

To Use for dummies:

1: Open a windows powershell or cmd prompt
2: CD into the directory where you have saved the Image Downloader 
3: Type "Python ImageDL.py"
4: Paste the image URL and viola your image is saved to the destination you selected prior.
